# Society in Silico - AI Writing Assistant Guide

## Book Overview

"Society in Silico" is a narrative non-fiction book about microsimulation, economic modeling, and policy technology. The author is Max Ghenis, founder of PolicyEngine and contributor to Cosilico.

## Voice & Style

- **Accessible**: Not a textbook. Explain technical concepts through stories and analogies
- **Personal**: Include Max's journey, but don't make it a memoir
- **Historically grounded**: Connect to the intellectual tradition (Orcutt, Harding, IFS, etc.)
- **Forward-looking**: Address AI implications thoughtfully, not breathlessly

### Tone Guidelines
- Write in active voice
- Use specific examples over abstract explanations
- Include numbers and data when they illuminate, not to impress
- Acknowledge uncertainty; don't oversell predictions
- Balance optimism about tools with honesty about limitations

## Key Themes

1. **Microsimulation as bridge**: How computational models connect academic research to policy decisions
2. **Open source as philosophy**: Why transparency matters for democratic policy analysis
3. **AI transformation**: What LLMs and agents mean for simulation, not hype but real implications
4. **Personal journey**: The path from economist to builder

## Important People to Reference

- **Guy Orcutt** (1917-2006): Father of microsimulation, 1957 paper
- **Ann Harding**: Pioneer in Australian microsimulation
- **Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, Camille Landais**: French tax simulator
- **IFS (Institute for Fiscal Studies)**: UK budget analysis tradition

## Technical Concepts to Explain Accessibly

- Microsimulation vs macroeconomic models
- Tax-benefit calculators
- Policy reform analysis
- Behavioral responses
- Static vs dynamic modeling
- Vectorized computation
- AI in policy analysis

## Chapter Drafting

When drafting chapters:
1. Start with a hook—a story, question, or surprising fact
2. Ground abstractions in concrete examples
3. Include "try it yourself" moments pointing to PolicyEngine
4. End chapters with forward momentum

## Research Integration
