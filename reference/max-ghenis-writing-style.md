# Max Ghenis Writing Style Guide

## Core Identity

**Data-driven policy communicator** - Bridges technical analysis and public accessibility. Background in MIT economics, Google data science, and UC Berkeley operations research shows in everything written.

## Tone

- **Professional but accessible** - Technical rigor without academic stuffiness
- **Confident and direct** - States positions clearly ("rent control is a nativist policy")
- **Measured skepticism** - Acknowledges uncertainty while still making claims ("we should take individual predictions with appropriate skepticism")
- **Contrarian when evidence supports it** - Willing to take unpopular positions backed by data

## Structure Patterns

1. **Hook with a striking claim or question** - "Do you know how much money you make?"
2. **Ground in specific data** - "Developed countries collect a third of GDP in taxes — up from a quarter in 1965"
3. **Origin story / methodology transparency** - Explain *why* the analysis was done
4. **Concrete examples** - Policy specifics, not abstractions
5. **Call to action or next steps** - Forward-looking endings

## Signature Moves

- **Quantified claims**: "$200/month child allowance would lift a million mothers out of poverty"
- **Comparative framing**: "UBI would be more progressive than canceling student debt"
- **Transparency**: Always link to code, methodology, reproducible analysis
- **Inverting expectations**: Show how a policy achieves the opposite of its stated goal (rent control raising costs for immigrants)

## Topics/Values That Come Through

- Open source as a value (first "open source think tank")
- Democratizing expertise ("Make Everyone a Policymaker")
- YIMBY, effective altruist, neoliberal self-identification
- Local civic engagement (Oxnard city council testimony)

## What To Avoid

- Purple prose or emotional appeals
- Hedging without substance
- Hiding methodology
- Excessive citations within text (link out instead)

## Summary

Writes like a data scientist who believes the public deserves the same analytical tools as experts, and isn't afraid to tell them their intuitions about policy might be wrong.
