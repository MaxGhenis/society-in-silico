Possible hooks:
- Guy Orcutt at his desk in 1957, frustrated with macro models

## Section: The Problem with Averages

Macroeconomic models of the 1950s told you about aggregates—GDP, total employment, average income. But policy acts on individuals. A tax change doesn't affect "the economy"; it affects millions of specific households, each differently.

Guy Orcutt saw this gap.

## Section: Orcutt's Vision (1957)

"A New Type of Socio-economic System" proposed something radical: instead of equations describing aggregate relationships, build a model of individual agents. Simulate each household. Let behavior emerge from the bottom up.

## Section: Early Implementation

The computational challenges were immense. DYNASIM in the 1970s required mainframes and teams of programmers. The vision outpaced the technology.

## Section: Why It Matters

The micro-macro distinction isn't just technical. It's about what questions you can answer:
- Macro: "Will GDP grow?"
- Micro: "Who gains? Who loses? By how much?"
