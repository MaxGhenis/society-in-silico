Opening scene concept:
A budget analyst in [location] running PolicyEngine simulations the night before

[Draft to come]

## Key Themes to Establish

1. The gap between policy debates (emotional, tribal) and policy analysis (computational, precise)
2. Models as translation devices between raw data and human understanding
3. The democratization thesis: these tools are becoming public infrastructure
4. Preview of the journey: history → building → future
