# Microsimulation Timeline

## 1950s - Origins

- **1957**: [[guy-orcutt]] publishes "A New Type of Socio-economic System" in *Review of Economics and Statistics*
  - Proposes simulating individual agents rather than aggregate equations
  - Born from frustration with macroeconomic models' inability to answer distributional questions

## 1960s - Early Development

- **1961**: Orcutt develops prototype microsimulation model
- **1964**: UK Chancellor James Callaghan announces tax reform plans (capital gains tax, corporation tax)
- **1965**: Institute for Fiscal Studies founded in response to Finance Act 1965
  - Founded by Will Hopper, Bob Buist, Nils Taube, John Chown
  - Motivation: government proposals were "half-baked"
- Computing limitations constrain ambition; mainframes required

## 1970s - Institutional Growth

- **1969**: Work begins on [[dynasim]] at Urban Institute under Orcutt
- **1972**: IFS appoints first full-time staff
- **1975**: First version of DYNASIM completed
  - 10,000 person sample
  - Simulated all major life events: birth, death, marriage, unemployment, migration
  - MASH software on DEC-10 (FORTRAN)
- **1975**: Meade Committee begins at IFS under Nobel laureate James Meade
  - John Kay (later IFS director) assists
  - Mervyn King (later Bank of England governor) assists
- Data infrastructure improves (CPS, etc.)

## 1980s - Spread

- **1983**: IFS launches [[ifs-taxben]] - first version
  - Uses Family Expenditure Survey (~7,000 UK households)
  - Proprietary model
- Interest spreads internationally:
  - Germany
  - UK
  - Australia ([[ann-harding]])
- Smaller-scale models become feasible as computing costs fall

## 1990s - Institutionalization

- **1993**: NBER [[taxsim]] documented (Feenberg & Coutts paper)
  - ~20,000 lines of FORTRAN 77
  - Federal law from 1960; state laws from 1977
- **1993**: International conference on microsimulation in Canberra
  - Edited by [[ann-harding]]
  - Published as "Microsimulation and Public Policy"
- **1995**: TAXBEN documentation updated (Giles & McCrae)
- IFS role in UK budget analysis solidifies

## 2000s - Democratization Begins

- Computing power makes models more accessible
- Academic models proliferate
- Web-based calculators emerge
- Survey data quality improves

## 2010s - Open Source Turn

- **2011**: [[openfisca]] launched at France Centre d'analyse stratégique
  - Support from IDEP (Aix-Marseille)
  - First open-source national tax-benefit model
- **2011**: Piketty/Saez/Landais publish French tax reform analysis using their simulator
- **2016**: OGP Paris Summit
  - OpenFisca team models Senegal income tax in <36 hours
  - Demonstrates international portability
- **2018**: New Zealand Better Rules initiative begins
  - [[rules-as-code]] approach
  - Rates Rebate app—first production RaC service outside Europe
- **2019**: OpenFisca recognized as most innovative open source software by European Commission

## 2020s - AI Era

- **2019**: [[max-ghenis]] founds [[ubi-center]]
  - Open-source UBI research
  - Incubates PolicyEngine
- **2020**: Max Ghenis completes MIT master's in Data, Economics, and Development Policy
- **2021**: [[policyengine]] founded by Max Ghenis and [[nikhil-woodruff]]
  - Spun out of UBI Center
  - UK model launched first
  - Built on OpenFisca fork
- **2021**: PolicyEngine UK announced (September)
- **2022**: PolicyEngine US launched
- **2024**: PolicyEngine Canada in development
- **2024-2025**: AI experiments with Rules as Code (Beeck Center/Digital Benefits Network)
  - LLMs can help translate policy to code
  - Works best with detailed prompts and simple policy logic
- [[cosilico]] emerges: AI-augmented policy encoding with systematic validation

## Themes Across Time

### Technology Enabling Vision
- 1957: Concept precedes computing capability by 18 years
- 1975: Mainframes finally sufficient for DYNASIM
- 2010s: Cloud computing enables web-based simulation
- 2020s: LLMs offer new encoding possibilities

### Openness vs. Proprietary
- 1983-2010s: Institutional models (TAXBEN, TAXSIM) dominate; limited access
- 2011-present: Open source models (OpenFisca, PolicyEngine) democratize access

### Geography
- 1957-1980s: US-dominated
- 1980s-1990s: UK, Australia, Germany join
- 2010s-present: Global (France, Tunisia, NZ, Australia, Canada...)
