## I. Models, Prediction, and Uncertainty

### George E. P. Box (Statistician)

> "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."
>
> — *Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces* (1987)

> "Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a 'correct' one by excessive elaboration."
>
> — "Science and Statistics," *JASA* (1976)

**Context**: Box emphasized that models are simplifications of reality—they can never fully capture complexity, but carefully designed models provide remarkably useful approximations for prediction and optimization.

**Book usage**: Chapter 1 (introducing microsimulation's purpose), Chapter 10 (uncertainty gap)

### Daniel Kahneman (Behavioral Economist, Nobel Laureate)

> "The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future."
>
> — *Thinking, Fast and Slow*

> "An unbiased appreciation of uncertainty is a cornerstone of rationality—but it is not what people and organizations want. Extreme uncertainty is paralyzing under dangerous circumstances, and the admission that one is merely guessing is especially unacceptable when the stakes are high. Acting on pretended knowledge is often the preferred solution."
>
> — *Thinking, Fast and Slow*

> "People come up with coherent stories and confident predictions even when they know little or nothing. Overconfidence arises because people are often blind to their own blindness."
>
> — *Thinking, Fast and Slow*

**Context**: Kahneman's work on cognitive biases shows how people systematically overestimate their predictive abilities and underappreciate uncertainty. Highly relevant to Chapter 10's discussion of false precision.

**Book usage**: Chapter 10 (uncertainty gap - why point estimates are dangerous)

### Karl Popper (Philosopher of Science)

> "In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable."
>
> — *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*

> "Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite."
>
> — Attributed

**Context**: Popper's falsificationism emphasizes that scientific theories must be testable and refutable. His "Open Society" philosophy aligns with the book's democratic vision—progress requires subjecting ideas to critical scrutiny.

**Book usage**: Part 1 (scientific foundations of microsimulation), Introduction/Conclusion (open vs closed systems)

## II. Knowledge, Information, and Distributed Intelligence

### F. A. Hayek (Economist, Nobel Laureate)

> "The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess."
>
> — "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945)

> "If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them."
>
> — "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945)

> "Practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation."
>
> — "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945)

**Context**: Hayek's "knowledge problem" argues that centralized planning fails because relevant information is distributed among individuals. This creates an interesting tension with microsimulation: can computational models capture distributed knowledge, or do they impose central assumptions?

**Book usage**: Chapter 1 (the aggregation problem), Part 3 (limitations of models, importance of household-level data)

### Amartya Sen (Economist, Philosopher, Nobel Laureate)

> "An individual's welfare should not be measured in terms of her income, but in terms of what she can actually do or be—her capabilities."
>
> — Capability Approach (paraphrase)

**Context**: Sen's capability approach shifts focus from income/GDP to actual human freedoms and opportunities. His work inspired the UN's Human Development Index. Relevant to the book's emphasis on household-level impacts vs aggregate metrics.

**Book usage**: Chapter 1 (critique of macro models), Chapter 5 (household view)

**Sources**:

### Paul Romer (Economist, Nobel Laureate)

> "Mathiness uses a mixture of words and symbols, but instead of making tight links, it leaves ample room for slippage between statements in the languages of words as opposed to symbols, and between statements with theoretical as opposed to empirical content."
>
> — "Mathiness in the Theory of Economic Growth" (2015)

> "A necessary condition for making this kind of progress is a capacity for reaching consensus that is grounded in logic and evidence."
>
> — On scientific progress in economics

**Context**: Romer's critique of "mathiness" warns against using mathematical formalism to obscure rather than clarify. He emphasizes maintaining tight connections between theory, mathematical models, and empirical evidence—exactly what microsimulation aims to do.

**Book usage**: Introduction (why transparent models matter), Part 2 (rules as code)

### Barack Obama (44th U.S. President)

**Open Government Initiative (2009)**

**Three Principles**:
1. **Transparency**: Government should be transparent
2. **Participation**: Government should be participatory
3. **Collaboration**: Government should be collaborative

**Context**: On his first day in office (January 20, 2009), Obama issued the Open Government Initiative, committing to "an unprecedented level of openness in Government." His administration made tens of thousands of datasets public on Data.gov and promoted evidence-based policymaking.

**Book usage**: Part 2 (open data movement), Introduction (democratic vision)

### Transparency International

> "The integrity of political systems depends on transparency about who funds parties, candidates and campaigns, yet political finance remains one of the weakest points in many countries' integrity landscape."
>
> — CoSP11 advocacy (December 2024)

> "Political influence should be exercised in the open, not channelled through hidden networks of undisclosed money."
>
> — CoSP11 resolution (2024)

**Book usage**: Introduction (open vs closed systems of power)

## IV. Open Source and Collaborative Development

### Eric S. Raymond (Open Source Advocate)

> "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
>
> — *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* (1999)

**Full statement**: "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone."

**Context**: Known as "Linus's Law" (named after Linus Torvalds), this encapsulates the core argument for open-source development: transparency and collaboration lead to better, more reliable software. Directly applicable to open-source policy models.

**Caveat**: The law has faced criticism—the Heartbleed bug persisted for two years despite being in widely-used open source code. Robert Glass calls it a "mantra" lacking empirical support. Important to acknowledge limitations while using the quote.

**Book usage**: Part 2 (open source microsimulation), Chapter 3 (open source revolution)

## V. Behavioral Economics and Nudges

### Cass Sunstein & Richard Thaler

> "A nudge is any form of choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without restricting options or significantly changing their economic incentives."
>
> — *Nudge* (2008)

> "The libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like—and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so."
>
> — *Nudge* (2008)

**Golden Rule of Nudging**: "Offer nudges that are most likely to help and least likely to inflict harm."

**Context**: Sunstein and Thaler's work on "libertarian paternalism" shows how policy design affects behavior. Relevant to microsimulation's role in policy design—understanding behavioral responses to policy changes.

**Transparency concern**: Some nudges are non-transparent, raising ethical questions. This connects to the book's emphasis on transparent, auditable policy tools.

**Book usage**: Part 2 (behavioral responses in models), Part 3 (AI and choice architecture)

**Sources**:
- [Wikipedia: Nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book))
- [Behavioral Scientist: Nudge Turns 10](https://behavioralscientist.org/nudge-turns-10-a-qa-with-cass-sunstein/)

## VI. Policy Analysis and Evidence

### From Government Transparency Advocates

> "The overarching purpose of access to information legislation is to facilitate democracy by ensuring that citizens have the information required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process, and that politicians and bureaucrats remain accountable to the citizenry."
>
> — Freedom of Information and Privacy Association

**Book usage**: Introduction (why open models matter), Conclusion (democratic vision)
