# Interview Questions for Microsimulation Pioneers

Draft questions for oral history interviews. Tailor based on conversation flow.

## George Sadowsky

*Treasury pioneer (1962-65), introduced computerized revenue estimation*

### Origin Story
1. What brought you to the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis in 1962? What was the state of policy analysis there?

2. Can you describe the moment when you realized computers could be used for revenue estimation? What was that first model like?

3. The Revenue Act of 1964 was a major piece of legislation. What role did your microsimulation work play in its development?

### Technical Challenges
4. What were the biggest technical constraints you faced in the early 1960s? How did you work around them?

5. How did you get the data? What compromises did you have to make?

### Impact and Legacy
6. When did you realize that microsimulation would become standard practice in government?

7. You later went to Brookings and Urban Institute—did you see a connection between your Treasury work and what Orcutt was building at Urban?

8. What do you think of modern open-source tax calculators like PolicyEngine? Would 1960s-you have imagined this?

### Broader Reflection
9. Looking back, what do you wish you'd done differently?

10. What advice would you give someone building policy analysis tools today?

## Howard Reed

*Landman Economics founder, IFS TAXBEN veteran, UK inequality focus*

### Career Path
1. You went from IFS to IPPR to founding Landman Economics. What drove each transition?

2. At IFS (2000-2004), you were responsible for TAXBEN. What was that experience like? What did you learn about building institutional models?

3. You've described wanting to create "a new settlement of the same scale as Beveridge reforms of 1945." Can you explain that vision?

### The UK Ecosystem
4. The UK has a remarkably dense ecosystem of tax-benefit models—IFS, IPPR, UKMOD, yours. How do they compete and complement each other?

5. The IPPR model charges fees and doesn't publish documentation. Your model is more accessible. Was that a deliberate choice?

6. How has devolution (Scotland, Wales) changed the landscape for UK microsimulation?

### Universal Basic Income
7. You've done more UBI microsimulation than almost anyone. What have you learned that surprises you?

8. Is there a UBI design that "works" in microsimulation terms—revenue neutral, reduces poverty, politically feasible?

### Open Source and Accessibility
9. PolicyEngine now operates in the UK. How do you see open-source models changing the landscape?

10. What's the hardest thing to get right in a tax-benefit model that outsiders don't appreciate?

## John Sabelhaus

*Former CBO chief of Long-Term Modeling (built CBOLT), now Fed*

### Building CBOLT
1. What was the state of long-term fiscal modeling at CBO when you arrived? What gap was CBOLT meant to fill?

2. CBOLT projects individual earnings over entire lifetimes. Why was that design choice so important?

3. What were the hardest technical problems you had to solve?

### CBO Culture
4. CBO has a reputation for nonpartisanship. How did that affect how you built and communicated about the model?

5. How do you handle it when politicians don't like your numbers?

6. What's the relationship between CBO's short-term tax model and CBOLT? Do they talk to each other?

### Social Security Analysis
7. CBOLT has been central to Social Security reform debates. What's it like to see your model's outputs in congressional testimony?

8. What do policymakers most misunderstand about long-term projections?

### At the Fed
9. You now oversee the Survey of Consumer Finances. How does that work connect to your microsimulation background?

10. If you were building CBOLT today, what would you do differently?

## Malcolm Torry

*Citizen's Basic Income Trust director, EUROMOD microsimulation on UBI*

### Motivation
1. What drew you to basic income as a cause? How did you come to microsimulation as a tool?

2. You've done nearly 10 years of microsimulation research on UBI. What keeps you going?

### Using EUROMOD
3. You're not an academic institution—you're a civil society advocate. How did you get access to EUROMOD?

4. What was the learning curve like? What support did you get from Essex?

5. What can EUROMOD show that simpler calculations can't?

### Key Findings
6. You found that a meaningful Basic Income is achievable at a 23% basic rate. Can you explain that finding?

7. What's the most counterintuitive result you've found in your microsimulation work?

8. How do you handle the objection that behavioral responses would undermine your static estimates?

### Advocacy and Analysis
9. How do you maintain credibility as both advocate and analyst? Do people dismiss your findings because of your advocacy role?

10. What would convince you that UBI is a bad idea?

### The Future
11. If the UK government wanted to seriously study UBI, what would you recommend they do?

12. What do you wish microsimulation could tell you that it currently can't?
