# Daniel Feenberg

NBER researcher who built and maintained TAXSIM from early 1980s through his career.

## Background

- National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
- Early 1980s: Began building TAXSIM
- 1990s: Made it internet-accessible - one of the first online tax calculators

## TAXSIM

Tax simulation model that calculates federal and state income tax liabilities for survey respondents, enabling academic research that would otherwise be impossible.

### Characteristics
- **Scope**: Individual-level tax calculator
- **Purpose**: Research tool, not policy analysis platform
- **Output**: Calculated taxes for individual records
- **Limitation**: Didn't produce aggregate estimates and distributional tables that drove policy debates
- **Access**: Freely available to academics
- **Reliability**: Documented, maintained consistently over decades

## Significance

Quiet but essential contribution that enabled generations of tax research. Demonstrated that useful tools could be built outside government, even if they couldn't fully replicate official infrastructure. When researchers needed to calculate tax liabilities for survey respondents, TAXSIM was there—reliable and accessible.
