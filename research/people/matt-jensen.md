# Matt Jensen

Founder of Open Source Policy Center at American Enterprise Institute.

## Key Achievement

**2014**: Founded Open Source Policy Center at AEI

## Vision

Diagnosis: "The closed-source approach to estimating the costs and economic impact of policies raises challenges, as there is limited accessibility and transparency in the process, leaving the public and many policymakers in the dark."

Solution: Open-source policy analysis tools

Quote: "By adopting an open source approach, we are able to provide policy makers, journalists and the general public with the information they need to understand policy. We are also able to leverage the knowledge and interest of experts and the general public to improve our models and make government better."

## Key Contribution

- Founded OSPC at AEI (conservative think tank funding open-source tools - ideological flexibility)
- Recruited Martin Holmer to build Tax-Calculator
- Built Policy Simulation Library ecosystem

## Significance

Brought open-source ethos to policy modeling in the US. Showed that transparency and accessibility cut across ideological lines (conservative think tank championing open source).

## Appears in Manuscript

**Chapter 2 (Tax Model Wars)** - mentioned
- Section: "Open Source Emergence" (line 73)
- Coverage: Very brief - "Matt Jensen founded the Open Source Policy Center at the American Enterprise Institute and built Tax-Calculator"

**Chapter 3 (Open Source Revolution)** - PRIMARY
- Section: Opening (lines 7-9)
- Coverage: Introduced alongside OpenFisca as parallel movement (2014 founding)
- Quote: "The closed-source approach..." diagnosis
- Action: Recruited Martin Holmer (MIT PhD, decades of microsimulation experience)
- Section: Could expand in "Two Architectures" if needed

## Note on Duplication

The brief Ch2 mention is appropriate - it's part of the historical landscape. Ch3 opens with Jensen + OpenFisca together as "the open source revolution" with more detail. Not problematic duplication.
