## The Founding Story

From the UBI Center:
> "We sought to expand the UBI Center's analysis from the US (where Max lives) to the UK (where Nikhil lives), but there was no open source model of the UK tax and benefit system — so we created it. There was also no web app to interact with a model of the UK system, so we created that too."

This origin story—building the tool you need because it doesn't exist—is a classic entrepreneurial pattern.

## Book Narrative Notes

Nikhil represents the technical co-founder archetype: young (started during undergrad), computer science background, built the infrastructure that makes the policy vision possible. The US-UK collaboration is enabled by remote work and open source culture.
