# Ann Harding

**Role**: Pioneer in Australian microsimulation
**Institution**: National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM), University of Canberra

## Significance

Ann Harding was instrumental in developing microsimulation in Australia and promoting it internationally. She edited the influential volume "Microsimulation and Public Policy" from the 1993 Canberra conference.

## Key Contributions

### 1993 Canberra Conference
The International Association for Research into Income and Wealth held a special conference on microsimulation in Canberra. Harding edited the resulting volume, which captured the state of the field in the early 1990s.

### NATSEM
Led development of Australian microsimulation capacity, making Australia one of the leading countries in the field.

## Historical Context

The 1980s saw microsimulation spread from the US to other countries:
- Germany
- UK
- Australia

Australia, under Harding's leadership, became a significant hub for microsimulation research and practice.

## Book Narrative Notes

Harding represents the "second generation" of microsimulation—those who took Orcutt's American invention and adapted it to other national contexts. The 1993 conference she organized was a key moment of international coordination.
