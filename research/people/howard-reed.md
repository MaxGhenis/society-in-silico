# Howard Reed

Independent policy analyst. Founded Landman Economics, built own Tax-Transfer Model for UK analysis.

## Career Path

- **2000-2004**: Ran TAXBEN at Institute for Fiscal Studies
  - Learned "the craft of institutional model maintenance"
- **IPPR**: Chief Economist
  - Saw how think tanks used microsimulation to shape debates
- **2008**: Founded Landman Economics
  - Built his own Tax-Transfer Model

## Tax-Transfer Model

Independent microsimulation model used for:
- Universal Basic Income analysis
- Welfare reform analysis
- Cumulative impact of austerity

Produced "the kind of detailed distributional analysis that had once been the exclusive domain of government and established think tanks."

## Vision

Goal: "a new settlement of the same scale and sustainability as the Beveridge-inspired reforms of 1945"

## Significance

Demonstrates the path from institutional modeler (IFS) to independent analyst enabled by open tools like UKMOD. Bridges the old world (proprietary models at established institutions) and new world (independent analysts with access to open tools).
