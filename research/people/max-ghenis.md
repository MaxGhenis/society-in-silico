**Role**: Author, Co-founder & CEO of PolicyEngine, Founder of UBI Center

## The Simulation Thread

A thread runs through the entire career: simulation as a way to understand complex systems.

### Finelite Internship (College)
- First professional simulation work: modeling light fixture manufacturing
- The seed of seeing how discrete-event simulation could illuminate operational decisions

### Berkeley IEOR (2008)
- B.A. in Operations Research and Management Science
- Minors: Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, Music
- **Transformative course**: IEOR simulation class
- Learned to model systems as interacting components, run scenarios, understand emergent behavior

### Google People Analytics (2010-2015)
- Co-founded People Analytics Data Science team
- **Built headcount forecast simulation**: Monte Carlo model chaining ARIMA, Cox survival models, and random forests
- Modeled: candidates in job pipelines → recruiting staff capacity → internal mobility → attrition rates → company growth
- This is societal simulation at company scale—the same conceptual framework as microsimulation

### YouTube (2015-2018)
- Product analyst / data scientist
- Emerging markets, YouTube Go (low-bandwidth app)
- Bayesian time series for causal impact estimation
- Began getting interested in **UBI and CTC** policy

## The Pivot to Policy

### Discovering Tax-Calculator (~2017-2018)
- Wanted to test UBI and CTC ideas quantitatively
- Didn't want to leave Google immediately for a think tank
- Found **AEI's Tax-Calculator** project (Open Source Policy Center)
- Started using it, then contributing to it
- The open-source model showed what was possible

### Three Months Off (~2018)
- Took leave from Google to work on policy issues full-time
- Contributed to Tax-Calculator's imputation of CPS variables to IRS data
- Produced synthetic releasable version of IRS Public Use File
- Conducted distributional analysis of EITC, CTC, UBI
- **Was hooked.** Returned to Google briefly, then left entirely.

### Independent Researcher (July 2018 - March 2019)
- Full commitment to open-source policy analysis
- Part of the Open Source Policy Center / PSL ecosystem
- Built foundation for what would become UBI Center

## The Academic Interlude

### MIT (2020)
- M.S. in Data, Economics, and Development Policy
- Saw "amazingly clever causal identification strategies" for understanding policy effects
- **The Gap**: These insights often weren't incorporated into actual policymaking
- A paper showing X causes Y doesn't tell a legislator what their specific bill will do
- Simulation could bridge this gap:
  - Takes empirical findings (elasticities, behavioral responses)
  - Applies them to specific policy proposals
  - Given current circumstances and the details of the bill
  - Produces actionable estimates

## The Bridge Thesis

The insight that connects everything:

> Researchers produce causal evidence about policy mechanisms. Policymakers need to know the impact of specific proposals. Simulation is the bridge—incorporating empirical findings into tools that can evaluate novel policies that don't match past studies exactly.

This is why simulation matters:
1. **Researchers** generate the behavioral parameters
2. **Simulation** encodes those parameters with policy rules
3. **Policymakers** can query impacts of new proposals
4. **Citizens** can see how changes affect their own households

## Book Narrative Notes

The origin story has three acts:

**Act 1: Simulation as Tool**
- Finelite, Berkeley IEOR, Google headcount model
- Learning that complex systems can be modeled, scenarios tested

**Act 2: The Policy Turn**
- Interest in UBI/CTC while at Google
- Tax-Calculator as gateway to open-source policy
- Taking the leap (3 months → full commitment)

**Act 3: The Synthesis**
- MIT shows the research-policy gap
- PolicyEngine as the bridge
- Cosilico as the infrastructure layer

The thread: simulation is how you make knowledge *actionable*.
