# Guy Orcutt

**Born**: 1917
**Died**: 2006
**Role**: Father of microsimulation

## The Frustration

In the 1950s, Orcutt was an economist working with macroeconomic projection models. His frustration: these models told you about aggregates (GDP, total employment) but couldn't answer distributional questions. A tax change doesn't affect "the economy"—it affects millions of households, each differently.

## The Vision (1957)

"A New Type of Socio-economic System" proposed a radical alternative:

> Instead of equations describing aggregate relationships, build a model of individual agents. Simulate each household. Let behavior emerge from the bottom up.

This was "microanalytic simulation"—later shortened to microsimulation.

## Key Contributions

1. **1957 paper**: "A New Type of Socio-economic System" - founding document
2. **1961**: Prototype microsimulation model
3. **1969-1975**: Led [[dynasim]] development at Urban Institute
4. **Later**: Contributed to CORSIM

## The Implementation Challenge

Orcutt's vision outpaced technology. The concepts were clear in 1957, but implementation required:
- Computing power that barely existed
- Microdata that wasn't yet collected
- Teams of programmers
- Mainframe access

The 18-year gap between concept (1957) and working model (1975) shows how visionary the idea was.

## Legacy

DYNASIM spawned an international family:
- CORSIM (US)
- CANSIM (Canada)
- SVERIGE (Sweden)

Every modern microsimulation model—including [[policyengine]]—traces intellectual lineage to Orcutt.

## Book Narrative Notes

Orcutt is the founding figure—the Newton of microsimulation. His story has narrative appeal:
- Frustration with existing tools
- Radical conceptual leap
- Decades of patient implementation
- Legacy that outlived him

The gap between vision and implementation (1957-1975) is a recurring theme: ideas often precede the infrastructure needed to realize them.
