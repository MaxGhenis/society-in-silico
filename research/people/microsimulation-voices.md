# Voices of Microsimulation: Quotes from Pioneers

Quotes revealing the motivations and worldviews of microsimulation's creators.

---

## Guy Orcutt (1917-2006)

Founder of microsimulation. Electrical engineer turned economist.

### On the Limitations of Macro Models

> "Existing models of our socio-economic system have proved to be of rather limited predictive usefulness. This is particularly true with respect to predictions about the effects of alternative governmental actions and with respect to any predictions of a long-range character."
> — "A New Type of Socio-Economic System" (1957)

### On the Aggregation Problem

> "There is an inherent difficulty, if not practical impossibility, in aggregating anything but absurdly simple relationships about elemental decision-making units."
> — 1957 paper

### On His Vision

> "The most distinctive feature of this new type of model is the key role played by actual decision-making units of the real world such as the individual, the household, and the firm."
> — 1957 paper

### On the Challenge

> "The problem of keeping track of all possible paths and their respective probabilities appears rather appalling."
> — 1957 paper

### Background Context

Orcutt harbored a "Tinbergen dream" of building a model covering the national economy. As a trained engineer and physicist, he "viewed the socioeconomic system as an electrical-mechanical network." Microsimulation was "an engine designed for not only scrutinizing the system but reengineering the society."

## Steven Caldwell (1941-2025)

Creator of CORSIM. Cornell sociologist.

### On Microsimulation's Purpose

> "Microsimulation is a 'bottom-up' strategy for modeling the interacting behavior of decision-makers (such as individuals, families, and firms) within a larger system."
> — Caldwell (1997)

### On Observation

> "Just as simulations in astronomy are used to 'observe' processes which are difficult or impossible to observe with other methods, so microsimulation can be used to 'observe' processes and outcomes for which no respectable data exist from other sources."
> — Caldwell and Morrison (2000)

### Background Context

Caldwell's worldview was shaped by a Fulbright to India where "immersion in Indian society ignited a lifelong passion for social justice, poverty alleviation, and equality." His publications "emphasized heterogeneity in responses to policy interventions and the distributional consequences of social programs."

## Ann Harding (1958-2023)

Founder of NATSEM (Australia). First President of IMA.

### On Why She Built NATSEM

> "The reason for making the centre an independent institution is that it will be available as a national resource to anyone who wants to use it for strategic planning and to help improve the level of social and economic policy-making. It's going to help construct a much more informed debate about social policy."
> — Canberra Times (1993)

### On Her Philosophy

> "The crucial importance of project management has become clearer to me."
> — IMA Presidential address

### Colleagues' Reflections

> "She was truly passionate about microsimulation, and how it could be used for good policy development."
> — IMA tribute

> "She stressed the importance of understanding how policies impacted on different segments of society."
> — Simon Kelly

> "She combined these skills and vision with charm and accessibility."
> — Cathal O'Donoghue

### Background Context

Became one of Australia's youngest professors at 34. Believed "geography was an essential driver of disadvantage." Her STINMOD model "was used in every budget and election for over two decades."

## Matt Jensen

Founder of OSPC/Policy Simulation Library. AEI.

### On Open Source Policy

> "By adopting an open source approach, we are able to provide policy makers, journalists and the general public with the information they need to understand policy."
> — TaxBrain launch (2015)

### On Collaboration

> "We are also able to leverage the knowledge and interest of experts and the general public to improve our models and make government better."
> — AEI press release

### Background Context

Frustrated by the "closed-source approach to estimating the costs and economic impact of policies" which "raises challenges, as there is limited accessibility and transparency in the process, leaving the public and many policymakers in the dark."

## Holly Sutherland

Director of EUROMOD (1996-2018). University of Essex.

### On EUROMOD's Mission

> "EUROMOD is of value both in terms of assessing the effects of consolidated tax-benefit policies and in understanding how tax-benefit policy reforms may affect income distribution, work incentives and government budgets."
> — EUROMOD documentation

### Background Context

"More than 30 years of experience of designing, building and using such models – the UK model she helped to develop in the mid-1980s was one of the very first anywhere." Research interests include "the gender effects of redistribution policy and child poverty measurement." Current interest in "extending microsimulation capacity to developing countries and to groups without access to such models."

## Howard Reed

Founder of Landman Economics. Former IFS, IPPR.

### Background Context

After working at IFS (responsible for TAXBEN 2000-2004) and IPPR (Chief Economist 2004-2008), Reed founded Landman Economics in 2008 to address "the UK's status as a high poverty and high inequality country" where both "have risen sharply since the post-1961 low point in the late 1970s, with profound consequences for health and social outcomes, life chances and social resilience."

Part of a team "aimed at creating a new settlement of the same scale and sustainability as that of the Beveridge-inspired reforms of 1945."

## Common Themes

1. **Frustration with aggregate models** - Orcutt's founding insight
2. **Social justice motivation** - Caldwell (India), Harding (disadvantage), Reed (inequality)
3. **Democratic transparency** - Jensen (public access), Harding (informed debate)
4. **Heterogeneity matters** - Understanding who wins and loses, not just averages
5. **Policy change is possible** - Microsimulation as tool for "reengineering society"
