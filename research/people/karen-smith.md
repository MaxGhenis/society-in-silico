## Appears in Manuscript

**Chapter 2 (Tax Model Wars)** - PRIMARY
- Section: "The American Machinery" (line 23)
- Coverage: Introduced alongside government agencies (JCT, Treasury, CBO)
- Role: Shows Urban Institute building analytical infrastructure adjacent to government
- Timeline: Joined Urban in 1980s, spent 3 decades on microsimulation
- Models: Lead roles in MINT (SSA's retirement income model) and DYNASIM (Urban's dynamic microsimulation)
- Significance: Building expertise that would "bridge the mainframe era into the age of open source"
- Context: While Urban served government clients rather than challenging official estimates, Smith was building critical modeling expertise
