Cosilico represents the next evolution of policy encoding: moving from manually coded rules to AI-assisted, systematically validated implementations.

## The Core Problem

Traditional microsimulation faces a fundamental challenge: **encoding accuracy**.

When humans translate legislation into code:
- Errors creep in
- Edge cases get missed
- Updates lag behind law changes
- Validation is inconsistent

## The Cosilico Approach

### 1. Systematic Parameterization
Every number in the code must trace to an authoritative source. No hard-coded magic numbers—all values are parameters with documented origins.

### 2. Multi-Source Validation
Code is validated against multiple authoritative calculators and official sources. Discrepancies trigger investigation.

### 3. AI-Assisted Encoding
LLMs can help:
- Parse legislative text
- Identify relevant parameters
- Generate initial code
- Find potential edge cases

But human expertise remains essential for validation.

## Relationship to PolicyEngine

Cosilico and [[policyengine]] are complementary:
- PolicyEngine provides the simulation infrastructure
- Cosilico focuses on encoding accuracy and methodology

## Connection to Rules as Code

Cosilico operationalizes [[rules-as-code]] principles:
- Legislation as machine-readable form
- Tight coupling between legal text and code
- Transparency and auditability

## The AI Opportunity

Recent research shows LLMs can support the Rules as Code pipeline:
- Extract programmable rules from policy documents
- Improve with detailed prompts and expert knowledge retrieval
- Work best on simpler policy logic

But limitations remain:
- Complex interdependencies challenge current models
- Legal interpretation requires human judgment
- Validation against ground truth is essential

## Book Narrative Notes

Cosilico represents where the field is heading: AI-augmented policy encoding that maintains rigor while scaling capacity. It's the answer to "how do we encode all the world's tax and benefit systems?"

The tension between automation and accuracy is central. AI can help, but the goal isn't replacement—it's augmentation.
