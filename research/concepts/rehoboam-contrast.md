# Rehoboam: The Dystopian Mirror

**Source**: Westworld Season 3 (2020)
**Relevance**: Narrative foil for the book's thesis

## The Fictional System

Rehoboam is a quantum AI system created by Engerraund Serac (Vincent Cassel), a French trillionaire driven by trauma—watching Paris destroyed by nuclear strike. His response: eliminate human freedom to prevent human mistakes.

### What Rehoboam Does

- Predicts individual life outcomes, including time and manner of death
- Assigns people to "paths" based on algorithmic predictions
- Manipulates social systems to create the future it predicts
- Identifies "outliers" who deviate from predictions—and "reconditions" them

### The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

The system denies opportunities to people it predicts will fail, thereby *creating* the failure it predicts:

> "Rehoboam is the reason Caleb can't get a better job. The machine foresees that Cal will commit suicide in roughly 10 years. Since the projections are for Cal to take his own life, the system doesn't want to devote time and resources to make his life better."

Serac's philosophy: "His job isn't to predict the future like an oracle, but to create it."

## The Contrast: Rehoboam vs. Open Simulation

| Dimension | Rehoboam | Open Microsimulation |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Ownership** | One trillionaire | Public infrastructure |
| **Access** | Secret | Transparent |
| **Purpose** | Control behavior | Inform choices |
| **Agency** | Eliminated | Empowered |
| **Predictions** | Deterministic destiny | Conditional scenarios |
| **Outliers** | Problem to eliminate | Diversity to understand |
| **Governance** | Autocratic | Democratic |

## The Philosophical Fork

Both Rehoboam and [[cosilico]]/[[policyengine]] start from the same premise:
- Society can be modeled computationally
- Predictions about policy impacts are possible
- Better models lead to better outcomes

But they diverge fundamentally on:

### Who controls the model?
- **Rehoboam**: One person decides what "better" means
- **Open**: Society collectively debates, model is shared substrate for reasoning

### What's the model for?
- **Rehoboam**: Creating a predetermined future, eliminating variance
- **Open**: Exploring possible futures, informing democratic choice

### How does it treat individuals?
- **Rehoboam**: Subjects to be optimized, sorted, controlled
- **Open**: Citizens who can query their own situation, understand their options

## The "Outliers" Question

Rehoboam treats people who don't fit predictions as threats—"outliers" to be "reconditioned."

An open system treats unpredicted behavior as *information*:
- The model was wrong → improve the model
- The policy created unexpected incentives → redesign the policy
- Human creativity exceeds algorithmic prediction → that's a feature

## Key Quote for Book

> "Society is hard to optimize because nobody has a shared model to reason against."
> — Cosilico thesis

The difference between Serac and the open vision:
- Serac: "I have the model, so I'll optimize society."
- Open: "We share the model, so we can reason together."

## Narrative Arc for Book

**Introduction hook**: The Westworld scenario isn't science fiction. Governments and corporations already use predictive models to allocate resources, deny benefits, assess risk. The question isn't whether we'll have societal simulation—it's whether it will be Serac's closed system or something democratic.

**Part III framing**: AI makes Rehoboam-style systems more feasible. But AI also makes open systems more feasible. The choice is ours.

**Ending vision**: What if Rehoboam had been open source? What if anyone could:
- Query their predicted path
- Challenge the assumptions
- Propose alternative policies
- Vote on which futures to pursue

That's not science fiction. That's what we're building.
