# UBI Center

**Founded**: 2019
**Founder**: [[max-ghenis]]
**Type**: Open-source think tank
**Focus**: Universal basic income policy research

## Mission

> "To produce open-source research to inform a robust debate around UBI policies."

## Key Research Areas

### Child Poverty
- $200/month child allowance would lift 1 million mothers out of poverty
- Replacing Child Tax Credit with child allowance reduces child poverty without adding cost

### Climate and Carbon Dividends
- UK: £100/tonne carbon dividend would cut poverty by 14%, deep child poverty by 33%
- US: $100/ton carbon dividend would cut poverty by 10%, deep child poverty by 27%

### Racial and Gender Disparities
- "The bigger the UBI, the smaller the racial disparities"
- Women are 17% more likely to be in poverty than men; UBI would shrink the gap

### COVID-19 Response
- UBI policies offsetting income losses should include children to cost-effectively stabilize poverty

### Yang's Freedom Dividend
- Analysis showed it would dramatically reduce poverty and inequality
- Even budget-neutral version (~$500/month) would have significant impact

## Output

- 30+ research works examining UBI from multiple angles
- Workshops for designing customizable UBI policies
- COVID-19 specific research site

## Team

### Founding Researchers
- **Nate Golden**: First researcher recruited. Middle school math teacher in Washington, DC. Passionate about using evidence-based policy to fight poverty.
- **Nikhil Woodruff**: Second researcher. Found via post on basic income subreddit in early 2020. College student in UK with rare combination of economic policy interest and software engineering skill. Would go on to co-found PolicyEngine.

## Relationship to PolicyEngine

> "The UBI Center originally incubated PolicyEngine, and now it primarily applies PolicyEngine software for its research."

The UBI Center needed analytical tools that didn't exist, so it built them. PolicyEngine is the tool; UBI Center is a primary user.

The path:
1. UBI Center founded 2019 to do UBI research
2. Needed comprehensive tax-benefit modeling tools
3. Met Nikhil Woodruff (early 2020) who could build UK model
4. Built OpenFisca UK and web interface (2020-2021)
5. Launched PolicyEngine UK (October 2021)
6. Spun off PolicyEngine as separate nonprofit with broader mission

## Why Open Source?

The "open-source think tank" model is distinctive:
- All data and code publicly available
- Anyone can reproduce findings
- Enables collaboration and extension
- Builds trust through transparency

## Book Narrative Notes

The UBI Center origin story is important: it shows Max's path from curiosity about UBI → need for analytical tools → building those tools → realizing they have broader applications beyond UBI.

UBI's "high cost" requiring "reforms to the rest of the tax and benefit system" is what drove the need for comprehensive modeling.
