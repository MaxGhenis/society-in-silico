# Microsimulation

## Definition

Microsimulation is a modeling technique that operates on individual units (people, households, firms) rather than aggregates. It simulates how policy rules affect each unit in a sample, then aggregates results.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Unit of analysis**: Individuals or households, not economy-wide aggregates
2. **Rule-based**: Applies policy rules (tax code, benefit eligibility) to each unit
3. **Data-driven**: Uses survey or administrative data for realistic population
4. **Distributional**: Can answer "who gains, who loses" questions

## Contrast with Macroeconomic Models

| Aspect | Microsimulation | Macro Models |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Unit | Individual | Economy |
| Output | Distribution | Averages |
| Data | Survey/admin | National accounts |
| Questions | Distributional impact | GDP effects |

## Types

- **Static**: No behavioral response, arithmetic only
- **Behavioral**: Models how people change behavior in response to policy
- **Dynamic**: Projects forward in time with demographic changes

## Examples

- TAXSIM (NBER, US)
- IFS models (UK)
- OpenFisca (international)
- PolicyEngine (US, UK)

## Accessible Explanation

Imagine you have data on 100,000 households—their incomes, family sizes, employment status. Now imagine Congress proposes a new tax credit. Microsimulation lets you calculate exactly how much each of those 100,000 households would receive, then add it up to get the total cost and see who benefits most.
