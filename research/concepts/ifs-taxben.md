# IFS TAXBEN

**Institution**: Institute for Fiscal Studies (UK)
**First Version**: 1983
**Type**: Proprietary microsimulation model

## The Institute for Fiscal Studies

### Founding
Founded in response to the Finance Act 1965 by four financial professionals:
- Will Hopper (banker, later Conservative politician)
- Bob Buist (investment trust manager)
- Nils Taube (stockbroker)
- John Chown (tax consultant)

They formed the IFS because they felt James Callaghan's 1964 tax reform proposals (capital gains tax, corporation tax) were "half-baked."

### Key Figures
- **John Kay**: Early IFS director, contributed to Meade Committee
- **Mervyn King**: Assisted Meade Committee, later Governor of Bank of England
- **James Meade**: Nobel laureate, led the Meade Committee (1975) on tax reform

### Mission
> "To provide top quality economic analysis independent of government, political party or any other vested interest."

## TAXBEN Model

### History
- **1983**: First version developed
- **1990**: Major update documented
- **1995**: Key documentation by Christopher Giles and Julian McCrae
- **2009**: Presentation at BSPS Conference
- **2016**: Workshop at European Commission JRC

### What It Does

A tax and benefit model that calculates effects of fiscal changes on a sample of households. Uses Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data—a representative sample of ~7,000 UK households.

Enables:
- Revenue estimates for policy changes
- Distributional analysis (who gains, who loses)
- Analysis by demographic subgroups

### Limitations

**TAXBEN is proprietary and not available to outside researchers.**

This is a key contrast with [[openfisca]] and [[policyengine]]—the open source movement is partly a response to the "black box" nature of institutional models like TAXBEN.

## IFS's Role in UK Policy

The IFS plays a distinctive role in UK governance:
- Provides independent budget analysis
- Frequently cited in Parliament
- Trusted by media for fiscal commentary
- "Green Budget" publication before each fiscal event

## UKMOD Alternative

UKMOD is a newer open tax-benefit model for the UK's four nations, providing an alternative to the closed TAXBEN model.

## Book Narrative Notes

The IFS represents the "institutional" model of microsimulation—expert-driven, proprietary, trusted by establishment. This has strengths (credibility, resources) but also limitations (accessibility, transparency).

The founding story is interesting: practitioners creating analytical capacity because government proposals weren't rigorous enough. A private-sector check on public policy.
