# TRIM3

Transfer Income Model, version 3 - comprehensive US safety net microsimulation.

## Institution

Urban Institute (funded by HHS/ASPE)

## History

**Oldest lineage in microsimulation**:
- **1969**: RIM (Reforms in Income Maintenance) - President's Commission on Income Maintenance Programs
- **1973**: TRIM version 1
- **1980**: TRIM2
- **Current**: TRIM3

## Purpose

Simulate major governmental tax, benefit, and health insurance programs affecting US population.

## Programs Modeled

**Cash transfers**:
- Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
- TANF
- Child support
- LIHEAP

**In-kind transfers**:
- Child care subsidies (CCDF)
- Public/subsidized housing
- SNAP
- WIC

**Also**: Medicaid, CHIP, taxes, tax credits

## Four Key Functions

1. **Eligibility estimation** → participation rate calculation
2. **Underreporting correction** in survey data
3. **Policy simulation** (hypothetical/proposed)
4. **Economic well-being analysis** (after-tax, after-transfer)

## Data Sources

- Current Population Survey (Annual Social and Economic Supplement)
- American Community Survey (for state-level)

## Key Application

Used by National Academies to assess child poverty reduction policies using Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM).

## Significance

Over 40 years of continuous use for safety net analysis. The RIM→TRIM lineage predates even [[dynasim]].
