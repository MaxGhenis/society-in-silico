# CBOLT

Congressional Budget Office Long-Term Model - CBO's microsimulation for Social Security and fiscal projections.

## Institution

Congressional Budget Office (CBO)

## History

- **Early 2000s**: Created for long-term Social Security projections
- **2004**: First technical documentation (Technical Paper 2004-01)
- **Ongoing**: Continually expanded capabilities

## Purpose

- Long-term federal budget projections
- Social Security finances and distributional effects
- Population size and composition
- Effects of policy changes
- Uncertainty analysis

## Key Feature: Individual-Level Projection

Unlike aggregate models, CBOLT projects at individual level:
- Educational attainment
- Marriage transitions
- Labor force participation
- Immigration/emigration
- Social Security claiming patterns
- **Lifetime earnings** (key determinant of taxes paid and benefits received)

## Data Source

Social Security Administration's Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS) - 1% sample of SSN holders

## Three Solution Modes

1. Static simulations with fixed macro environment
2. Macro growth model with actuarial modules
3. Integrated micro/macro model

## Key Outputs

- *The Long-Term Budget Outlook*
- *Long-Term Projections for Social Security*
- *Social Security Policy Options*
- Options for reducing deficit

## Relationship to Other Models

Complements CBO's tax microsimulation model (shorter-term tax analysis)
