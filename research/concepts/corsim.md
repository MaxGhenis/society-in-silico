## Institution

Cornell University

## Creator

## History

- **1987**: Initiated, building on DYNASIM experience
- **Base year**: 1960 US Census PUMS (180,000 records)

## Scale

Among the largest microsimulation models:
- ~1,100 equations
- ~7,000 parameters
- ~26 behavioral modules
- Dozens of algorithms

## What It Simulates

- Schooling
- Labor supply
- Demographics
- Risk factors (smoking, alcohol, diabetes)
- Wealth accumulation
- Life events

## Key Difference from DYNASIM

CORSIM is fully dynamic, single integrated model (vs. DYNASIM's modular approach)

## International Influence

CORSIM methodology adapted for:
- **DYNACAN** (Canada)
- **SVERIGE** (Sweden)
- **POLISIM** (US Social Security Administration)
