# EUROMOD

Tax-benefit microsimulation model covering all European Union member states.

## History

- **Origins**: 1996, EU-funded (FP3, FP4, FP5 projects)
- **Initial coverage**: EU-15 countries
- **2005-2008**: I-CUE project extended to 2004 accession countries
- **2004-2018**: Developed at University of Essex (ISER Microsimulation Unit)
- **2021-present**: Managed by JRC (Joint Research Centre), European Commission

## Data

EU-SILC (European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions), harmonized by Eurostat

## Key Feature

Enables comparable cross-country analysis of tax-benefit policies across EU member states.

## Expansion: SOUTHMOD

The EUROMOD platform now powers models for Global South countries (funded by UNU-WIDER):
- Ghana, Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Ecuador, Vietnam

## Relationship to UKMOD

[[ukmod]] is a spin-off based on the UK component of EUROMOD, continuing independent development after Brexit.

## Significance

The most ambitious multi-country microsimulation project. Demonstrates feasibility of harmonized cross-national tax-benefit modeling. Institutional transfer from university to EU agency shows model sustainability challenges.
