## Key People

- **Martin Holmer** - President and senior economist at Policy Simulation Group, key Tax-Calculator developer

## Models

- **Tax-Calculator**: Microsimulation of federal individual income and payroll tax
- **Tax-Data**: Prepares microdata for Tax-Calculator
- **Behavior-Response**: Behavioral response modeling
- **Tax-Brain**: Web interface (now in maintenance)
- **Tax-Cruncher**: Individual tax calculator

## Philosophy

"By adopting an open source approach, we are able to provide policy makers, journalists and the general public with the information they need to understand policy." — Matt Jensen

## Validation

Tax-Calculator results compared to:
- Hand calculations using IRS forms
- Dan Feenberg/Ina Shapiro SAS program at NBER (connects to [[taxsim]])

## Users

Scholars inside/outside AEI, other think tanks, governmental agencies

## Significance

First open-source microsimulation model of US individual income tax. Demonstrates open-source policy modeling is viable. PolicyEngine US builds on similar principles.
