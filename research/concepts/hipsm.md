# HIPSM

Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model - Urban Institute's health coverage microsimulation.

## Institution

Urban Institute (Health Policy Center + Tax Policy Center)

## Funders

Stoneman Family Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kaiser Family Foundation, Urban Institute

## Purpose

Estimate cost and coverage effects of health care policy options.

## Unique Methodology

Combines two decision-making approaches:
1. **Elasticity-based** responses
2. **Expected utility** calculations

Simulates:
- Insurance company reactions to policy changes
- Employer reactions to insurers
- Individual choices based on resulting options
- Iterates to equilibrium

## Data

Publicly available data → realistic sample of American population

## Notable Impact

**King v. Burwell (Supreme Court)**: HIPSM findings cited in majority opinion and many amicus briefs

**Massachusetts 2006**: Predecessor model provided roadmap for landmark health reform → Health Services Research Impact Award 2007

**Obama Administration**: Technical assistance using HIPSM

## Media Coverage

NY Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Vox, CNN, LA Times

Results displayed on Senate floor during debate

## Example Analysis

ACA repeal would increase uninsured Black population to 20% vs 14% for white population → reveals distributional/equity impacts

## Significance

Demonstrates microsimulation's policy influence: academic model → Supreme Court citation → legislation design
