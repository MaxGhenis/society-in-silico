## Key Themes

1. **Urban Institute dominance**: DYNASIM, TRIM, HIPSM, TPC model - massive portfolio
2. **Government vs. academic vs. open**: Different access, different trust
3. **Static vs. dynamic**: Tax models mostly static; retirement models dynamic
4. **Domain silos**: Tax people don't talk to health people
5. **Open source emerging**: PSL, UKMOD, SimPaths - new generation
