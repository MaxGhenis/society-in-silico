# SimPaths

Open-source life course microsimulation framework from University of Essex.

## Institution

Centre for Microsimulation and Policy Analysis (CeMPA), University of Essex

## Authors

Matteo Richiardi, Patryk Bronka, Justin van de Ven, Daniel Kopasker, Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi

## License

EUPL-1.2 (European Free/Open Source Software)

## What It Models

Life course events with dynamic feedback:
- Education
- Work/career
- Family life
- Health
- Financial circumstances

Linked to underlying tax-benefit model for realistic policy impact.

## Country Coverage

Current:
- UK (workhorse model)
- Greece
- Hungary
- Italy
- Poland

Under development:
- Germany
- Spain
- Sweden

## Validation

UK projections closely match observed data from Financial Crisis (2011) to Covid-19 (2019).

## Technical Platform

Built on JAS-mine simulation framework (also open-source, EUPL-1.2)

## Significance

Represents new generation of open-source dynamic microsimulation. Complements [[ukmod]] (static) with life-course dynamics.
