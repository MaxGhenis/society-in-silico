# Society in Silico - Working Outline

## Front Matter

### Preface
- Why write this book now
- Who it's for (policy wonks, technologists, curious citizens)
- What this isn't (a textbook, a memoir, a manifesto)

### Introduction: The Model and the World
- Opening scene: A budget analyst running simulations the night before a major policy vote
- The gap between policy debates and policy understanding
- Thesis: Computational models of society are becoming democratic infrastructure

## Part I: Origins

### Chapter 1: The Birth of Microsimulation
- Guy Orcutt's 1957 vision
- The macro-micro split in economics

- Early computers and the first models (DYNASIM)

### Chapter 2: From Academia to Government
- The IFS and UK budget scoring tradition
- NBER's TAXSIM
- How microsimulation became institutional
- The expertise barrier

### Chapter 3: The Data Foundation
- Survey data revolution (CPS, ACS, FRS)
- Administrative data emergence
- Privacy, access, and the public interest
- What you can and can't learn from data

- The UK launch and US expansion
- Balancing accuracy with accessibility
- When the model meets politics

### Chapter 6: Encoding the Law

## Part III: Future

### Chapter 8: AI Enters the Room
