# Consistency Check: 01-introduction.md

## Terminology Issues

### "open-source" vs "open source"
- Line 57: "open-source movement" → should be "open source movement" (no hyphen when used as noun phrase)
- Line 83: "open source as philosophy" → CORRECT (no hyphen)
- Line 89: "open-source turn" → should be "open source turn" (no hyphen)

**Recommendation**: Use "open source" (two words, no hyphen) as noun. Use "open-source" (hyphenated) only as compound adjective before a noun (e.g., "open-source software"). Lines 57 and 89 should be unhyphenated.

### Names - Full Name + Context Usage
- Line 29: "Engerraund Serac" (full name on first mention) → CORRECT
- Line 31: "Serac's philosophy" (last name after) → CORRECT
- Line 87: "Orcutt's frustration" (last name only, no first mention with context) → Should be "Guy Orcutt's frustration" or add context earlier

**Issue**: Guy Orcutt appears in line 87 (Part I summary) without being introduced with full name first. While he's mentioned in line 57 with full name, that's in a different section and Part I could be read independently. Consider adding "(Guy Orcutt)" at first Part I mention.

### Numbers
All instances appear correct:
- Line 47: "67%" → CORRECT (numerals for percentages)
- Line 87: "1957" → CORRECT (numerals for years)
- Line 29: "Season 3" → CORRECT (numerals 10+)

## Capitalization

### Chapter Title
- Line 1: "Introduction: The Model and the World" → CORRECT (Title Case)

### Section Headings
- Line 43: "## The Stakes" → CORRECT (Title Case for major sections)
- Line 55: "## The Alternative" → CORRECT
- Line 73: "## Key Themes" → CORRECT
- Line 85: "## What's Ahead" → CORRECT
- Line 97: "## Research Links" → CORRECT

### Part Titles (within text)
- Line 87: "**Part I: Origins**" → CORRECT (Title Case)
- Line 89: "**Part II: Building**" → CORRECT
- Line 91: "**Part III: Future**" → CORRECT

All capitalization follows the rules correctly.

## Missing Terminology Checks

### PolicyEngine
- Line 59: "PolicyEngine" → CORRECT (CamelCase)

### Cosilico
- Line 59: "Cosilico" → CORRECT (appears correctly)

### Microsimulation
- Line 101: "[[microsimulation-definition]]" (wiki link) - term not used in main text
- Should appear somewhere in the introduction to establish the pattern

**Issue**: The word "microsimulation" doesn't appear in the introduction body, only in research links. Consider adding it when describing the technology (e.g., line 33 "building systems that model society computationally" could be "building microsimulation systems").

### Tax-benefit
- Not mentioned in introduction (acceptable for intro chapter)

## Style Observations

### Em dashes
The manuscript uses em dashes extensively and correctly:
- Line 29: "Engerraund Serac—a French trillionaire" → CORRECT
- Line 57: "a different path—from Guy Orcutt's" → CORRECT
- Line 47: "time—GPT-4 achieves" → CORRECT

### Contractions
Uses contractions appropriately for accessible tone:
- Line 45: "don't" → appropriate for narrative non-fiction
- Line 51: "won't" → appropriate
- Line 59: "I'll" → appropriate

## Established Conventions (for style guide)

### Terminology
- **microsimulation**: One word, lowercase (except at sentence start) - should be introduced in introduction
- **PolicyEngine**: CamelCase, no space
- **Cosilico**: One word, capital C
- **open source**: Two words, no hyphen when used as noun or standalone phrase
- **open-source**: Hyphenated only when used as compound adjective directly before noun (e.g., "open-source movement" should be "open source movement" unless emphasizing it as a specific modifier)

### Names
- Full name on first substantial mention with context
- Last name only for subsequent references
- Exception: May need to reintroduce full name when starting major new sections (Parts)

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine
- Numerals for 10 and above
- Always numerals for: percentages, currency, years, "Season 3" type references

### Capitalization
- Chapter titles: Title Case
- Section headings (##): Title Case for major sections
- Part titles within text: Title Case

### Formatting
- Em dashes without spaces: word—word
- Wiki links: [[term-with-hyphens]]
- Contractions encouraged for accessible tone

## Recommendations

1. **Line 57**: Change "open-source movement" to "open source movement"
2. **Line 89**: Change "open-source turn" to "open source turn"
3. **Add "microsimulation"**: Introduce the term early (suggest line 33: "building microsimulation systems that model society")
4. **Part I mention of Orcutt**: Consider adding context since it's first mention in that section, or rely on line 57's introduction (acceptable either way)

## Summary

Overall, the introduction is highly consistent. Main issues:
- **2 instances** of incorrect "open-source" hyphenation when used as noun phrase
- **1 missing term**: "microsimulation" should appear in body text
- **1 minor issue**: Guy Orcutt could use re-introduction in Part I section

The writing establishes strong conventions that can be applied to subsequent chapters.
