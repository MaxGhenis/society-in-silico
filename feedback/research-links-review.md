# Research Links Review: 01-introduction.md

**File analyzed**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/manuscript/front-matter/01-introduction.md`
**Review date**: 2025-12-12

## Summary

The introduction already includes 4 wiki-links at the end (lines 99-103), but many terms in the main text could benefit from linking to existing research notes. I've identified 25+ linkable terms and 15 gaps where new research notes would strengthen the manuscript.

## Missing Research Notes (High Priority)

### 1. **Westworld/Engerraund Serac**
**Location**: Lines 29-36
**Term**: "Engerraund Serac" and "Westworld Season 3"
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/westworld-serac.md`
**Rationale**: The opening extensively discusses this character/show. While `rehoboam-contrast.md` exists, a separate note on Serac specifically would help track this recurring character reference.

### 2. **NBER/TAXSIM**
**Location**: Line 87
**Term**: "NBER models"
**Suggested path**: Already exists at `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/taxsim.md`
**Rationale**: Should link to existing note, possibly update it to emphasize NBER context.

### 3. **Meade Committee**
**Location**: Not in introduction, but mentioned in IFS research note
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/timeline/meade-committee-1975.md`
**Rationale**: The 1975 Meade Committee shaped UK tax reform thinking and had IFS involvement.

### 4. **GPT-4 Tax Accuracy / AI Limitations**
**Location**: Lines 47-48 ("GPT-4 achieves only 67% accuracy")
**Term**: AI tax accuracy, hallucination in tax calculations
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/ai-tax-accuracy.md`
**Rationale**: This is a key empirical finding cited in both the intro and Cosilico note. Deserves dedicated research note with citations (Chen et al. 2023 SARA benchmark).

### 5. **Digital Public Goods / Open Source Movement**
**Location**: Line 83 ("Open source as philosophy")
**Term**: Open source in policy analysis, digital public goods
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/digital-public-goods.md`
**Rationale**: PolicyEngine is recognized as a Digital Public Good. This broader movement deserves explanation.

### 6. **Predictive Models in Government**
**Location**: Lines 45-47 ("Governments already use predictive models...")
**Term**: Algorithmic governance, automated decision systems
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/algorithmic-governance.md`
**Rationale**: The intro contrasts "models we have" vs "models we should have." Background on existing government algorithmic systems would strengthen this.

### 7. **Distributional Analysis**
**Location**: Line 65 ("Understand who gains and loses from a policy reform")
**Term**: Distributional impact analysis
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/distributional-analysis.md`
**Rationale**: A core value proposition of microsimulation—contrast with aggregate models.

### 8. **Thomas Piketty / Emmanuel Saez / Camille Landais**
**Location**: Not in intro, but in CLAUDE.md as "Important People to Reference"
**Suggested paths**:
- `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/people/thomas-piketty.md`
- `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/people/emmanuel-saez.md`
**Rationale**: CLAUDE.md lists them as key figures re: French tax simulator.

### 9. **Static vs. Dynamic Modeling**
**Location**: Not directly in intro, but implied in Part III "Future" discussion
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/static-vs-dynamic-modeling.md`
**Rationale**: Mentioned in microsimulation-definition.md but deserves fuller treatment.

### 10. **Behavioral Response Modeling**
**Location**: Not in intro
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/behavioral-responses.md`
**Rationale**: Listed in CLAUDE.md as "Technical Concepts to Explain Accessibly."

### 11. **1957 Orcutt Paper**
**Location**: Line 57
**Term**: "Guy Orcutt's 1957 vision of simulating individual households"
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/timeline/orcutt-1957-paper.md`
**Rationale**: Foundational document—deserves dedicated timeline entry with direct quotes and context.

### 12. **Urban Institute**
**Location**: Not in intro, but DYNASIM note mentions Urban Institute extensively
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/people/urban-institute.md` (or concepts/)
**Rationale**: Institutional home of DYNASIM development.

### 13. **MIT Economics / Max's Journey**
**Location**: Line 59 ("from Google data scientist to MIT economist")
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/people/max-ghenis.md` (already exists)
**Note**: Should verify this note includes MIT details.

### 14. **Democratic Deliberation / Technocracy**
**Location**: Line 75 ("bridge it without technocracy")
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/technocracy-vs-democracy.md`
**Rationale**: Key tension in the book—models as tools for democracy vs. technocratic control.

### 15. **AI Agents and Tool Use**
**Location**: Line 91 ("what changes when language models can help write rules, when agents need reliable tools")
**Suggested path**: `/Users/maxghenis/society-in-silico/research/concepts/ai-agents-tool-use.md`
**Rationale**: Part III theme—LLMs using deterministic tools. Cosilico note mentions this.

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 16. **"Society in Silico" as Concept**
The book title itself could have a research note defining what "society in silico" means (computational society, digital twin of social systems, etc.).

### 17. **Napkin Math vs. Rigorous Analysis**
Line 62: "Congress debates with napkin math"—could link to note on policy analysis standards.

### 18. **Green Budget (IFS Publication)**
Mentioned in ifs-taxben.md—might deserve timeline or concept note.

### 19. **CORSIM, CANSIM, SVERIGE**
Mentioned in guy-orcutt.md and dynasim.md as DYNASIM descendants—could create individual notes or a single "dynasim-family.md" note.

### 20. **Vectorized Computation**
Listed in CLAUDE.md as technical concept to explain—relevant to how modern microsimulation scales.

## Obsidian Graph Impact

Adding these links will:
- Connect the introduction to 10+ existing people/concept notes
- Create clear pathways from intro → Part I (Orcutt, DYNASIM, IFS)
- Create clear pathways from intro → Part II (OpenFisca, PolicyEngine, rules-as-code)
- Create clear pathways from intro → Part III (AI agents, tool use, accuracy)
- Make the "Democratic vs. Autocratic" theme visually apparent through rehoboam-contrast connections

---

## Next Steps

1. **Quick win**: Add links to existing notes (Guy Orcutt, DYNASIM, IFS, OpenFisca, PolicyEngine, rules-as-code)
2. **High-value adds**: Create the Tier 1 research notes
3. **Update existing**: Verify `max-ghenis.md` includes MIT background
4. **Cross-reference**: Ensure new notes link back to introduction

## Notes on Link Syntax

Based on existing usage at lines 99-103, the book uses:
- `[[note-name]]` for simple links
- `[[note-name|Display Text]]` for custom display text

File names use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `guy-orcutt.md`, `microsimulation-definition.md`).
