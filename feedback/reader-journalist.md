## Reader Review: Journalist (Sarah)

### The Story
**Headline**: The Race to Build Democracy's Crystal Ball—Before Big Tech Does It First

**Lede**: When Max Ghenis watched Westworld's villain use AI to predict and control human behavior, he saw his own work staring back at him. For years, he'd been building computer models that simulate how policies affect millions of people—the same technology, but for radically different purposes. Now, as AI companies race to embed these systems into products used by millions, the question isn't whether we'll have computational models of society. It's whether they'll be controlled by a few powerful institutions or made transparent and accessible to everyone.

### Quotable Moments
- "I don't predict the future. I create it." (Serac's line—great villain quote that sets up the stakes)
- "AI assistants confidently give tax advice that's wrong a third of the time"
- "The question isn't whether we'll have computational models of society. We do."
- "That's not Rehoboam. That's the opposite of Rehoboam."
- "Society needs a shared model to reason against. Congress debates with napkin math."

### Fact-Check List
- [ ] GPT-4 67% accuracy on tax questions (Blair-Stanek et al. 2023, arXiv:2309.09992) - **VERIFIED: This is a real paper, need to confirm methodology**
- [ ] Guy Orcutt's 1957 vision—need source for this claim
- [ ] "Governments use predictive models to allocate benefits, assess fraud risk"—need specific examples and sourcing
- [ ] "Insurance companies price your premiums based on algorithms you can't inspect"—true but vague; need concrete case
- [ ] Author's credentials: "Google data scientist to MIT economist to founder of PolicyEngine and Cosilico"—need to verify timeline and roles
- [ ] Thermonuclear incident destroying Paris in Westworld—this is fiction, but fact-check the plot details for accuracy
- [ ] "Six decades of institutional models locked inside government agencies"—need examples: which agencies, which models?

### Would My Editor Run This?

**YES, but with conditions.**

**What works:**
- The Westworld hook is GOLD. It's pop culture that techies know, it's recent enough to be relevant, and it perfectly sets up the dystopia-vs-democracy tension
- The 67% GPT-4 stat is shocking and timely. Everyone's using ChatGPT for everything; this undermines trust in a visceral way
- The personal angle (author builds these systems) gives credibility
- Clear stakes: this isn't hypothetical, these systems exist and are shaping our lives

**What needs work:**
- **Sourcing is thin.** The insurance/bank algorithm claims need specific cases. Give me the ProPublica investigations, the lawsuits, the people harmed
- **The "we" is undefined.** Who is "we"? Policymakers? Citizens? The global "we"? Be specific about who has power and who doesn't
- **Missing the opposition.** Why DON'T we have this already? Who benefits from opacity? Where's the institutional resistance? The story needs antagonists beyond a fictional TV villain
- **No human face yet.** I need the budget analyst who stayed up all night. I need the family who got denied benefits because of a black-box algorithm. I need Guy Orcutt frustrated at his typewriter in 1957
- **Jargon creep.** "Microsimulation systems," "deterministic tools," "vectorized computation"—you lose civilians fast. Every technical term needs a one-sentence translation

### Interview Questions

1. **Give me the most egregious example you've seen of bad policy math.** What decision got made because Congress couldn't model the impact? Names, bills, consequences.

2. **Who's your villain?** Not Westworld—real institutions that benefit from keeping these models closed. TurboTax? Insurance companies? Treasury Department bureaucrats? I need quotes from them defending the status quo.

3. **Walk me through one specific person's experience.** Someone who used PolicyEngine to discover they qualified for $X in benefits they didn't know about. Or someone harmed by an opaque government algorithm. Make it real.

4. **What's the business model?** You're building open-source tools. Who pays for this? Is there a conflict of interest I should know about? (Not accusatory, just standard due diligence)

5. **The 67% stat—give me the failure mode.** What specific tax question did GPT-4 botch? Show me the screenshot, the wrong answer, what it would cost a real family.

6. **Who's doing this wrong?** Name names. Which companies or governments are building "Rehoboam-style" systems right now? What are they doing with them?

7. **What's the regulatory angle?** Should these models be mandatory? Should governments be required to open-source their policy simulators? Is there legislation pending?

8. **Play devil's advocate.** Why might transparency be bad? Could adversaries game the system if it's fully open? What do your critics say?

9. **The AI pivot—what changed in 2023?** You've been building this since 2018. Why write the book now? What's the urgency?

10. **Give me your wildest vision.** If this works perfectly, what does policy-making look like in 2030? Paint the picture.

### Additional Notes for the Author

**Structure concern:** You have three different opening options in the comments. Pick one and commit. The draft uses Option A, which is the right choice, but it hedges. Cut the meta-commentary about which opening to use—it breaks the narrative spell.

**Missing transition:** The jump from "That's what this book is about" (line 39) to "We don't have Rehoboam" (line 45) is abrupt. Bridge it. One sentence acknowledging we're moving from fiction to reality.

**The "democratic moment" phrase** (line 59): Evocative but vague. What is the moment? AI? Open source maturity? Political polarization creating demand for neutral tools? Name it.

**Reader engagement:** I'd finish this. The hook works, the stakes are clear, and the tension between transparency and control is compelling. But I'd skim the middle section (Key Themes, What's Ahead) because it feels like a textbook table of contents. Can you make the roadmap narrative instead of bulleted?

**Comp titles:** This reminds me of:
- "The Master Algorithm" (Pedro Domingos) for accessible tech explanation
- "Weapons of Math Destruction" (Cathy O'Neil) for policy impact of algorithms
- "The Perfectionist" (Simon Winchester) for personal-journey-meets-technology

But it's more hopeful than O'Neil, more policy-focused than Domingos. That's your lane—own it.

**Final thought:** The introduction does what it needs to do: it makes me want to know what happens next. But for a general-interest publisher, you'll need more human stories woven throughout. The systems are fascinating; the people affected by them are the story.
