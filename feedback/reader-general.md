## Reader Review: General Reader (Elena)

### First Impressions

Okay, the Westworld hook worked on me. I'm in. The French trillionaire with the AI named Rehoboam predicting when you'll lose your job or die? That's genuinely creepy and made me want to know where this is going.

But then around "microsimulation systems" I felt the chapter split into two books: one I want to read (about whether AI is secretly controlling our lives) and one I'm less sure about (what sounds like a technical manual about economic modeling software).

### Where I Got Lost

**"Microsimulation systems that model society computationally"** (line 33) - This is where I had to re-read. I get "AI predicts your life," but "microsimulation" sounds like a graduate school term. What IS it? Is it like SimCity but for real people? Is it the algorithm that decides my credit score? I'm genuinely asking because I don't know.

**"Governments use predictive models to allocate benefits, assess fraud risk"** (line 47) - Wait, are we talking about the same thing as Rehoboam or something completely different? I thought this was about economic policy, but fraud detection sounds like... crime stuff? I'm confused about the scope here.

**The GPT-4 tax thing** (line 47) - This felt random. We went from Westworld AI controlling society to... ChatGPT being bad at taxes? How are these related? I think you're making a point about AI limitations, but it landed as a non sequitur.

**"Guy Orcutt's 1957 vision"** (line 57) - Who? Why does 1957 matter? This name-drop assumes I know why this is important. I don't.

**"From Google data scientist to MIT economist to founder of PolicyEngine and Cosilico"** (line 59) - I don't know what PolicyEngine or Cosilico are. Should I? Are these startups? Government agencies? I'm supposed to care about this journey but I don't know what these destinations mean.

**The bullet points (lines 64-67)** - These sound nice but abstract. "See how a proposed tax change would affect their household" - okay, but can't I already do this? Doesn't TurboTax tell me this? I genuinely don't understand what's new here.

### What Hooked Me

**The Westworld opening** - Loved this. "I don't predict the future. I create it" is a chilling line and made me think about how much AI already influences my life (Netflix recommendations, Instagram ads, even GPS routing). The Paris nuclear thing was dramatic enough to grab attention.

**"AI assistants confidently give tax advice that's wrong a third of the time"** - Wait, WHAT? I've asked ChatGPT tax questions! This scared me in a good way. Made me realize I don't know what I can trust.

**"Who builds them? Who can access them? What are they for?"** - This framing landed. Once you set it up as "open vs closed," I got why I should care. It's like asking whether Wikipedia or Encyclopedia Britannica should be how we share knowledge.

**The alternative vision** - The idea that I could see how policies affect MY family specifically? That's interesting. Right now politics feels like abstract shouting matches. If I could actually model "what happens to me if they cut the child tax credit?"... yeah, I'd use that.

### The "So What?" Test

Kind of? Here's what I understood:

1. There are computer models that simulate how policies affect people
2. Right now only governments and big companies have them
3. The author wants to make them public/open source
4. This matters because... democracy? Transparency?

But here's what I'm NOT sure about:

- **Is this already happening to me?** You mention banks and insurance companies using algorithms, but then talk about making tools public. Are these the same models? Am I already being "Rehoboam-ed" or is this about the future?

- **What's the actual problem?** Is it that these models exist in secret? That they're inaccurate? That normal people can't access them? All three? Something else?

- **How does this affect my life RIGHT NOW?** I pay taxes, I have insurance, I vote. But I finished this introduction not knowing whether my premiums or tax refund or anything I do today involves these "microsimulation" things you're talking about.

### Coffee Summary

"Okay so I'm reading this book about how AI and computer models predict how government policies affect people—like your taxes, benefits, all that. And right now only governments and companies have access to these tools, so you just have to trust them. But there's this movement to make them open source, like Wikipedia, so anyone could see how a new policy would affect their own family.

The author built some of these systems and has a Westworld reference? It's interesting but honestly pretty technical. I'm not totally sure yet whether this is about something already happening or a future thing. But the core question is good: should these powerful prediction tools be secret or public?"

### Would I Keep Reading?

**Hesitantly yes**, but you're losing me.

I'd turn the page because:
- The Westworld hook was effective
- The open/closed framing gives me a reason to care
- I'm curious about the "GPT-4 fails at taxes" thing and whether I should be worried
- The promise that I could see how policies affect MY life specifically is appealing

But I'm worried because:
- **Too many unexplained terms too fast** - "Microsimulation," "DYNASIM," "IFS," "TAXSIM," "OpenFisca," "PolicyEngine," "Cosilico," "rules-as-code." I counted 10+ unfamiliar terms in this introduction alone.

- **Unclear scope** - Is this about AI? Economics? Government policy? Software? All of the above? I don't have a mental model of what this book is.

- **The personal journey feels tacked on** - You mention your path (Google → MIT → founder) but I don't know why I should care yet. What made you build this? What problem were you trying to solve? Give me the human story, not the resume.

- **Missing the "holy shit" moment** - You've got interesting pieces (Westworld! AI failing at taxes! Secret algorithms!), but they don't connect into one clear "this is why this matters NOW" revelation.

### What Would Make Me Definitely Keep Reading

Show me one concrete example. Like:

"In 2023, Congress debated expanding the child tax credit. Parents had no way to calculate what it would mean for their family. Think tanks published reports with averages—'typical families would receive $2,000'—but you're not typical. You have three kids, you're married, you make $85K. What would YOU get? Nobody could tell you. The government had models that could answer this precisely. They chose not to share them."

Give me that and I'm in. Make me angry or scared or excited. Right now I'm intrigued but still at arm's length.

### Final Thought

You're writing for the Economist reader who got hooked by the Westworld premise. Don't lose her in jargon. Every time you use a term like "microsimulation" or drop a name like "Guy Orcutt," pause and explain why it matters in plain language. You're competing with my Kindle library and Netflix queue. Make me need to know what happens next.
