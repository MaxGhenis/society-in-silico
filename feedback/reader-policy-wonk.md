## Reader Review: Policy Wonk (Marcus)

### Professional Assessment
**Would I take this seriously at work?**

Honestly? I'd be intrigued but wary. The Westworld opening would make me roll my eyes in a meeting—we don't do HBO references in policy memos. But the core argument about open modeling infrastructure? That gets my attention.

The problem: you're writing like someone who builds models, not someone who uses them. I've worked with CBO scores for eight years. I know what microsimulation can and can't do. This intro promises a lot but doesn't grapple with why the status quo exists the way it does.

**Tentative interest, pending evidence of institutional awareness.**

### Policy Realism Check

**Naive assumptions:**

- **"Congress debates with napkin math"** - Tell that to CBO's 250-person staff who spend months modeling major bills. The problem isn't lack of models; it's that political decisions aren't driven by them. You can have perfect modeling and still get the 2017 tax bill.

- **"Voters can't see how policies affect their own families"** - PolicyEngine is nice, but voters also can't/won't read 10-page policy briefs. The bottleneck isn't computational—it's attention, trust, and the fact that most people have better things to do than run tax simulations.

- **"Open source as democratic value"** - CBO's models aren't open source, but they publish detailed methodology papers. JCT releases distributional tables. The transparency issue is real but more nuanced than "closed institutions bad, open source good."

- **"AI hallucinates eligibility rules"** - Yeah, but so do constituents, caseworkers, and sometimes even our legislative staff. GPT-4 at 67% on tax questions is bad, but what's the human baseline? I've seen credentialed professionals butcher this stuff.

- **Missing: Why institutional models exist** - You mention models "locked inside government agencies" like it's nefarious. But there are reasons: data access restrictions, liability concerns, need for consistent scoring, professional quality control. These aren't all just obstacles to overcome.

**Realistic insights:**

- **The Westworld fork is actually brilliant** - Serac vs. democratic alternative captures something real: we ARE building these systems, and governance structure matters. This could work if you lean harder into it.

- **Gap between debate and analysis** - Yes. This is real. Watching Ways & Means hearings where nobody understands the distributional tables is painful.

- **"Models as translation devices"** - Good framing. Policy text is genuinely incomprehensible. The 2017 TCJA was 503 pages of cross-references. Translation matters.

- **Open source movement timeline** - If you actually trace this from Orcutt through IFS/NBER to PolicyEngine, that's a story worth telling. The intellectual history angle could be compelling.

### "Would I Cite This?" Test

**Could I use this in a policy memo?**

Not yet. Here's what would need to change:

**For a Hill memo:** I need comparisons to CBO/JCT methodology, validation against official scores, institutional blessing (even one quote from a former CBO director), and case studies where open tools influenced actual legislation.

**For a think tank paper:** I need peer-reviewed evidence that open models produce equivalent accuracy, examples of PolicyEngine being used by actual policymakers (not just journalists or academics), and engagement with the counterarguments (Why hasn't this already happened? What are the legitimate concerns?).

**For testimony:** I'd need to answer "Why should Congress trust this over CBO?" with something better than "it's open source."

**What I could cite now:** The GPT-4 tax accuracy stat is useful. The Westworld analogy might work in a public-facing piece. The democratization argument could support proposals for CBO methodology transparency.

### Missing Context

**What does the author not understand about how policy works?**

1. **The political economy of scoring** - CBO has monopoly power for a reason. It's the neutral referee. Multiple competing models would be weaponized instantly. "My think tank's model shows no deficit impact!" This is a feature, not a bug, and you need to address it.

2. **Data access constraints** - Open source code doesn't help if you can't access IRS microdata. You mention this nowhere. Synthetic data is useful but limited. How do you validate without the real data?

3. **The implementation gap** - Great, everyone can simulate policy. Does that change votes? Does McConnell care that PolicyEngine says the child tax credit helps 3.5M kids? Politics isn't downstream of better information.

4. **Liability and quality control** - If someone makes a financial decision based on your calculator and it's wrong, who's responsible? Government agencies have layers of review. What's the open source equivalent?

5. **Why experts are skeptical** - You frame this as "closed institutions vs. open communities," but miss why institutional models evolved this way. Talk to former CBO staff. They'll tell you about the pressure, the manipulation attempts, the need for defensible methodology.

6. **The behavioral modeling problem** - Static scoring vs. dynamic is where ideological battles actually happen. You don't mention behavioral responses at all in the intro. That's where the real fights are.

### What Would Win Over Skeptics

**Evidence that would make this credible to DC:**

**Validation studies:**
- "PolicyEngine replicated CBO scores for [specific bill] within X% margin"
- "Treasury Department used open source tools to validate internal analysis"
- Independent academic verification of accuracy

**Real-world use cases:**
- "Senator X's office used PolicyEngine to design [bill]"
- "Think tank Y switched from proprietary tools to open source"
- "GAO review found open tools met quality standards"

**Institutional endorsements:**
- Quote from former CBO director
- Collaboration with JCT or Treasury
- Citation in official government report

**Addressing the hard questions:**
- How do you prevent partisan capture?
- What's the governance model for methodology disputes?
- How do you handle data access restrictions?
- What happens when simulations conflict with official scores?

**Demonstrating understanding:**
- Show you know why CBO does it their way
- Engage seriously with the counterarguments
- Propose complementary role, not replacement
- Acknowledge what models can't do

### Specific Suggestions

**Reframe the pitch:**
- Not "replace institutional models" but "democratize access to similar tools"
- Not "Congress uses napkin math" but "only a few hundred people can run these analyses"
- Not "AI hallucinates" but "precise tools matter more as AI enters policy space"

**Add institutional nuance:**
- Distinguish between CBO (defensible, but constrained) and private sector black boxes (genuinely problematic)
- Acknowledge valid reasons for current system
- Position open tools as complement, not competitor

**Include a skeptic character:**
- Literally put someone like me in the book
- Show the objections, then address them
- Don't strawman—use the strongest version of the argument

**Ground the democracy argument:**
- Show actual citizens using these tools
- Document cases where transparency mattered
- Demonstrate demand, not just supply

### Bottom Line

You've got something here, but it needs more institutional sophistication. The vision is compelling—I genuinely do want more transparency in policy modeling. But you're pitching to an audience that knows why the current system exists and needs convincing that the benefits outweigh the risks.

**The Westworld hook works better than you think.** That's the frame: we're at a fork. One path is proprietary algorithms making decisions about our lives that we can't inspect (that's happening). The other is transparent, accessible tools for democratic deliberation (that's your project). Make that contrast starker.

**But then get specific.** Show me PolicyEngine matching official scores. Show me legislators using it. Show me how you handle the data access problem, the validation problem, the governance problem. Show me you understand why CBO does what it does before proposing alternatives.

Do that, and I'll cite this book. Maybe even recommend it to the junior staff.

**Final grade: B+ for vision, C+ for institutional realism, A- for the Westworld frame**
